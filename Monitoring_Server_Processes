#Description: The purpose of this script is to monitor the server's processes and system performance. The script will allow the user to terminate processes that utilize too much memory.
#What will break this script: entering multiple PIDs, not entering any PID, and  not entering yes or no when prompted.

# List and sort the server processes.

ps -o pid,user,%mem,command ax | sort -b -k3 -r
echo "Is there a process in this list with %Mem usage greater than 10% (y/n)?"
read answer

# Ask user to terminate the process the exceeds the memory threshold.

if [ "$answer" != "${answer#[Yy]}" ] ;then 
    read -p "Enter PID with %Mem greater than 10%     " PID
    read -p "Process $PID must be terminated. Press enter to kill this process" user_command 
    kill -9 $PID
    echo "Process ID $PID has been terminated. Goodbye!"
exit

else
    echo "No process exceeds the memory threshold. Goodbye!"
exit
